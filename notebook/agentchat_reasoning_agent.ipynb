    "# ReasoningAgent - Advanced LLM Reasoning with Multiple Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` is designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities through systematic exploration of thought processes. By implementing the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, it enables LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama to break down complex problems into manageable steps and explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the key features and capabilities of the `ReasoningAgent`, showing how it can effectively reason about problems even when using smaller models like `gpt-4o-mini`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` supports multiple search strategies for exploring the reasoning space:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Beam Search (Default)\n",
    "- Maintains the top `k` most promising paths at each step\n",
    "- Efficient for problems with clear evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Configurable beam width to balance exploration vs computation\n",
    "- Special case: DFS mode (beam size = 1) for linear reasoning similar to Chain-of-Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "- Balances exploration and exploitation using UCT formula\n",
    "- Particularly effective for problems with delayed rewards\n",
    "- Stochastic exploration helps avoid local optima\n",
    "- Configurable number of simulations and exploration constant\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)\n",
    "- Provides immediate reflection feedback before the next simulation\n",
    "- Helps identify poor reasoning paths early for future improvement\n",
    "- Especially useful for complex multi-step reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thinker Agent**: Generates potential next steps in the reasoning process\n",
    "2. **Grader Agent**: Evaluates the quality of each reasoning step\n",
    "3. **Code Execution**: a child user agent will execute code automatically during reasoning\n",
    "4. **Tree Structure**: Organizes thoughts hierarchically for systematic exploration\n",
    "5. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in Graphviz support for analyzing reasoning paths\n",
    "6. **Logging Features**: Log and save thinking trajectories to finetune the language model\n",
    "7. **Configuration Options**: The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary"

    "Beam Search is a powerful technique used in tree-based reasoning that allows the agent to explore multiple paths simultaneously. By setting `beam_size` greater than 1, the agent can maintain several candidate solutions at each step, evaluating them based on their potential to lead to the best final answer. This method is particularly effective when the solution space is large and complex, as it balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that promising paths are prioritized while still considering alternative options.\n",

    "In this approach, the agent generates multiple reasoning steps in parallel, allowing it to compare different trajectories and select the most promising ones for further exploration. This can lead to more robust and accurate conclusions, especially in scenarios where intermediate evaluations are critical to the final outcome."

      "### Step 1: Simulation Approach\n",
      "In this approach, you can write a program that rolls a die three times for a large number of simulations (e.g., 10,000 or more) and records the maximum value from each set of three rolls. You then compute the average of these maximum values.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Analytical Calculation\n",
      "To analytically calculate the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, you can use the following logic:\n",
      "\n",
      "Let \\( X_1, X_2, X_3 \\) be three independent rolls of a fair 6-sided die. The expected maximum value, \\( E[\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3)] \\), can be calculated by considering the probability of getting each possible maximum value.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The possible maximum outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n",
      "2. Calculate the probability that the maximum result is less than or equal to \\( k \\) (for \\( k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\)):\n",
      "   - \\( P(\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \\leq k) = \\left( \\frac{k}{6} \\right)^3 \\), because each die must show a value that is less than or equal to \\( k \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum value is:\n",
      "   - \\( P(\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) = k) = P(\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \\leq k) - P(\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \\leq k-1) \\)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The expected value \\( E[\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3)] \\) can be calculated as:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   E[\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3)] = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} k \\times P(\\max(X_1, X_2, X_3) = k)\n",

      "5. Carrying out these sums gives:\n",

      "By running the simulation and calculating the expected maximum analytically, you could plot a graph comparing the simulation results with the analytical results.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Conclusion\n",

      "\n",
      "I performed an extensive statistical analysis by simulating the rolling of a 6-sided die three times over 100,000 trials. The maximum values were recorded for each trial, and the average of these maximum values was calculated.\n",

      "**Code Execution Result**:\n",
      "- The average maximum value obtained from the simulation is approximately **4.95939**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Analyze Variability\n",
      "\n",
      "To analyze how variability changes with the number of dice rolled, I performed additional simulations with different numbers of rolls (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 rolls). The goal was to observe how the expected maximum value and the variability of results change with the increased number of dice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expected Maximum Values from Additional Simulations**:\n",
      "- For 1 roll: \\( E[X_{\\text{max}}] \\approx 3.5 \\)\n",
      "- For 2 rolls: \\( E[X_{\\text{max}}] \\approx 4.25 \\)\n",

      "- The expected maximum value increases with the number of rolls.\n",
      "- Variability decreases as more dice are rolled, leading to a more predictable outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Mathematical Proof\n",
      "\n",
      "To justify the empirical observations mathematically, we can formulate the expected maximum value based on the number of dice rolled.\n",
      "\n",
      "When rolling \\( n \\) fair 6-sided dice, the expected maximum value can be expressed mathematically. The probability that the maximum value is less than or equal to \\( k \\) is given by:\n",

      "P(X_{\\text{max}} \\leq k) = \\left(\\frac{k}{6}\\right)^n\n",

      "\n",
      "The expected maximum value \\( E[X_{\\text{max}}] \\) can then be expressed as:\n",

      "E[X_{\\text{max}}] = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} k \\cdot \\left( \\left( \\frac{k}{6} \\right)^n - \\left( \\frac{k-1}{6} \\right)^n \\right)\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "This formula provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how the expected maximum value behaves with increasing rolls.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Summary and Report of Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary of Findings**:\n",
      "- **Expected Maximum for 3 Rolls**: Approximately **4.96** from simulation, closely aligning with the earlier analytical result (~4.97).\n",
      "- **Trends Observed**: Increasing the number of dice rolled tends to yield a higher expected maximum value, demonstrating reduced variability and predictability in outcomes.\n",
      "- **Mathematical Foundation**: The relationship between the number of dice and the expected maximum was established, reinforcing the observations from statistical analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Practical Implications**:\n",

      "1. **\\( P(X < 1) = 0 \\)** (It's impossible)\n",
