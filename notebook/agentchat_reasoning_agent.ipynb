    "# ReasoningAgent - Advanced LLM Reasoning with Multiple Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` is designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities through systematic exploration of thought processes. By implementing the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, it enables LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama to break down complex problems into manageable steps and explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the key features and capabilities of the `ReasoningAgent`, showing how it can effectively reason about problems even when using smaller models like `gpt-4o-mini`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` supports multiple search strategies for exploring the reasoning space:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Beam Search (Default)\n",
    "- Maintains the top `k` most promising paths at each step\n",
    "- Efficient for problems with clear evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Configurable beam width to balance exploration vs computation\n",
    "- Special case: DFS mode (beam size = 1) for linear reasoning similar to Chain-of-Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "- Balances exploration and exploitation using UCT formula\n",
    "- Particularly effective for problems with delayed rewards\n",
    "- Stochastic exploration helps avoid local optima\n",
    "- Configurable number of simulations and exploration constant\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)\n",
    "- Provides immediate reflection feedback before the next simulation\n",
    "- Helps identify poor reasoning paths early for future improvement\n",
    "- Especially useful for complex multi-step reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thinker Agent**: Generates potential next steps in the reasoning process\n",
    "2. **Grader Agent**: Evaluates the quality of each reasoning step\n",
    "3. **Code Execution**: a child user agent will execute code automatically during reasoning\n",
    "4. **Tree Structure**: Organizes thoughts hierarchically for systematic exploration\n",
    "5. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in Graphviz support for analyzing reasoning paths\n",
    "6. **Logging Features**: Log and save thinking trajectories to finetune the language model\n",
    "7. **Configuration Options**: The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary"

      "Explanation: The response begins with a reasonable step by mentioning the calculation of the probability distribution for the maximum value, which is relevant to solving the problem. However, the trajectory abruptly terminates at Step 2 without actually performing any calculations or advancing the thought process necessary to arrive at the final expected value. A productive thinking trajectory should ideally include the calculation process as well as a conclusion or answer; ending with \"TERMINATE\" does not contribute to solving the problem. This lack of completeness and failure to advance the thought process significantly reduce the effectiveness of the response.\n",

    "Beam Search is a powerful technique used in tree-based reasoning that allows the agent to explore multiple paths simultaneously. By setting `beam_size` greater than 1, the agent can maintain several candidate solutions at each step, evaluating them based on their potential to lead to the best final answer. This method is particularly effective when the solution space is large and complex, as it balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that promising paths are prioritized while still considering alternative options.\n",

      "\n",
      "The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately **4.97**. Understanding this expected maximum is significant because it provides insight into probabilistic outcomes in games, decision-making scenarios, and statistical analysis. It helps formulate strategies where maximizing outcomes is crucial.\n",

      "### Step 4: Alternative Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "While we used a probability distribution method for this calculation, alternative methods can be employed to compute expected maximum values, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Combinatorial Analysis**: This involves counting the number of ways to get specific maximums and calculating probabilities based on that. It might involve more complex arrangements but can yield reinforcing insights into the probabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Generating random samples of rolls and calculating the maximum across those samples can provide empirical results and validate theoretical calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both methods can enhance understanding and confidence in the theoretical results obtained through probability distributions. Such comprehensive exploration strengthens the understanding of expected max values in practical applications.\n",

      "\n",
      "When rolling a 6-sided die, the outcomes for each die roll range from 1 to 6. When rolling three dice, we want to find the maximum value \\( M \\) that could result from these rolls. \n",

      "2. **Formulate the Probability**:\n",

      "Explanation: This response effectively addresses the question by providing a detailed theoretical calculation of the expected maximum when rolling a 6-sided die three times. It follows a clear, logical structure, starting with an understanding of the problem, defining probabilities, calculating probabilities for each maximum value, and then concluding with the expected value. The mathematical calculations are mostly accurate, leading to an approximate result that is consistent with the provided ground truth.\n",

      "However, a slight discrepancy exists in the final calculation, where the expected maximum value is stated as approximately **4.97**, while the ground truth specifies it as approximately **4.9583**. This should have been aligned more closely for full accuracy, which is why it doesn't achieve a perfect score. Overall, the answer is very well-structured, concise, and informative.\n",

      "The expected maximum value from multiple rolls of a die becomes important when considering the highest number achievable. Given that we're rolling a 6-sided die (with faces numbered 1 through 6) three times, we need to evaluate the probabilities of each face of the die being the maximum showing from those rolls. The expected value (E) of a random variable can be calculated using the formula:\n",
