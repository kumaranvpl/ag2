    "# ReasoningAgent - Advanced LLM Reasoning with Multiple Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` is designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities through systematic exploration of thought processes. By implementing the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, it enables LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama to break down complex problems into manageable steps and explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the key features and capabilities of the `ReasoningAgent`, showing how it can effectively reason about problems even when using smaller models like `gpt-4o-mini`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` supports multiple search strategies for exploring the reasoning space:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Beam Search (Default)\n",
    "- Maintains the top `k` most promising paths at each step\n",
    "- Efficient for problems with clear evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Configurable beam width to balance exploration vs computation\n",
    "- Special case: DFS mode (beam size = 1) for linear reasoning similar to Chain-of-Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "- Balances exploration and exploitation using UCT formula\n",
    "- Particularly effective for problems with delayed rewards\n",
    "- Stochastic exploration helps avoid local optima\n",
    "- Configurable number of simulations and exploration constant\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)\n",
    "- Provides immediate reflection feedback before the next simulation\n",
    "- Helps identify poor reasoning paths early for future improvement\n",
    "- Especially useful for complex multi-step reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thinker Agent**: Generates potential next steps in the reasoning process\n",
    "2. **Grader Agent**: Evaluates the quality of each reasoning step\n",
    "3. **Tree Structure**: Organizes thoughts hierarchically for systematic exploration\n",
    "4. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in Graphviz support for analyzing reasoning paths\n",
    "5. **Logging Features**: Log and save thinking trajectories to finetune the language model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary:"

      "Explanation: The response begins with a reasonable step by mentioning the calculation of the probability distribution for the maximum value, which is relevant to solving the problem. However, the trajectory abruptly terminates at Step 2 without actually performing any calculations or advancing the thought process necessary to arrive at the final expected value. A productive thinking trajectory should ideally include the calculation process as well as a conclusion or answer; ending with \"TERMINATE\" does not contribute to solving the problem. This lack of completeness and failure to advance the thought process significantly reduce the effectiveness of the response.\n",

    "Beam Search is a powerful technique used in tree-based reasoning that allows the agent to explore multiple paths simultaneously. By setting `beam_size` greater than 1, the agent can maintain several candidate solutions at each step, evaluating them based on their potential to lead to the best final answer. This method is particularly effective when the solution space is large and complex, as it balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that promising paths are prioritized while still considering alternative options.\n",

      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The response effectively outlines a comprehensive simulation approach for estimating the expected maximum value from rolling a six-sided die three times, aligning well with the original question. It incorporates several steps, including creating and validating a simulation, accommodating different-sided dice, and refining the code for robustness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Strengths:\n",
      "- The answer includes a clear and relevant simulation example using Python, which directly addresses the question.\n",
      "- It validates the simulation results against theoretical values for one and two rolls, which is a logical step to ensure accuracy.\n",
      "- Step-by-step instructions demonstrate a well-structured approach and provide a pathway for understanding and implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Areas for Improvement:\n",
      "- While the response provides multiple steps for simulation and validation, it could be more concise by summarizing the theory behind calculating the expected maximum without losing essential details.\n",
      "- Some theoretical probabilities are mentioned, but a direct reference to the expected value of approximately \\( 4.97 \\) might help the user connect the simulation results to expected outcomes more clearly.\n",
      "- Also, there is a slight inconsistency regarding the result, where the simulation's expected maximum should ideally confirm the theoretical result of approximately \\( \\frac{119}{24} \\), which is about \\( 4.9583 \\) instead of merely stating around \\( 4.97 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while the response provides a well-rounded answer, a tighter focus on the connection between the simulation results and theoretical expectations would enhance its clarity and usefulness.\n",
